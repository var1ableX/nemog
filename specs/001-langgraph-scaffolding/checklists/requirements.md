# Specification Quality Checklist: LangGraph Application Scaffolding

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before planning
**Created**: 2026-02-17
**Feature**: [specs/001-langgraph-scaffolding/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) *Note: Since this IS a scaffolding feature, the specific architectural layers are the "What", while the specific code is the "How".*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (where possible)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (to the extent possible for a framework-specific scaffold)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The feature is ready for the planning phase.
